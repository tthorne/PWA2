Hello Ms. Silvestro,
I've had a few issues this weekend that I came across that I'm not understanding. I really thought that I would have figured it out by the time to turn this in.  I will contact you in the morning to try to get your help.  Changes were also made to the database and is included in the xhr folder.

Thank you,
Tara Thorne
